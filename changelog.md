### v4.5.0 **[LATEST STABLE RELEASE]** / **[LATEST BETA RELEASE]**
+ Attempt to add /merge and /cancel commands + linked callbacks. Actually failed

### v4.4.5
+ The logs are better. Putting the text message *before* file, as it does with URL & replies to text message instead of file
+ Made a way more permissive regex for URL
+ Fixed exceptions on nearly all commands
+ Performing a /restart send the logs automatically 

### v4.4.4
+ Definitely fixed #NEW_USER
+ Once again tweaks on BayFiles

### v4.4.3
+ Way better handling of `check_logs()` on start
+ Fixed the #NEW_USER
+ Few changes on BayFiles upload

### v4.4.2
+ A lot of changes on BayFiles upload :
  + Errors sent to logs
  + Formatting the results with size, url and filename
  + Correct formatting of the errors
  + Created get_cloud(), will improve it to let choose the upload platform for the user (bayfiles, anonfiles, â€¦)

### v4.4.1
+ Instead of using things from other users, I use the official curl method from BayFiles docs

### v4.4.0
+ If a file is above 2 Gb, it's uploaded to Bayfiles instead
+ Better get_files() according to what Nexa made. Looks faster

### v4.3.4
+ Fixed crashes
+ Made `/stats` working for non owner, as requested in [#34](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/34)

### v4.3.3
+ Added `/getthumbs`, which don't work ðŸ˜…
+ User Name is better on the database (better formatting when he joins)

### v4.3.2

### v4.3.1

+ That version crashes
+ The thumbnail is resized according to Telegram API specifications
+ Thumbnails are saved to a separate folder
+ Created thumb_exists()

### v4.3.0
+ Created this changelog to track updates
+ Once again updated the uptime
+ Added numpy and Pillow in the requirements
+ Tried to have a thumbnail support. Nevertheless, it's removed at each restart. Will look for a Telegra.ph support

### v4.2.1
+ Major bug fixes

### v4.2.0
+ Added workaround for [issue #26](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/26)
+ The bot now edit its messages each 7s (instead of 10s)
+ Attempt to make a really better ETA
+ Working around allowing user to cancel file/URL download (will look for the extracting process, bot can't reply while extracting)

### v4.1.1
+ Reduced amount of lines in logs (that was too much ðŸ’€)
+ Definitely fixed the bug of `v4.0.1`
+ Better texts
+ Keyboard now refreshes correctly after sending a file

### v4.0.5
+ Tried to add date+time on logs filename. Can't actually do it because I will need to work with wildcards
+ Added logging for motor and asyncio
+ Added `/sendto` that works like `/broadcast` but to a single user. Works with chats and channels too. Will look for handling replies as well
+ You can use commands in more places

### v4.0.4
+ Major bug fixes
+ Upload count return 0 instead of None if it doesn't exist
+ Try to automatically perform a `/clean` when a task failed

### v4.0.3 *(.2 don't exists ðŸ¥²)*
+ `/mode` work finally as expected *(previous behavior added users to banned db when they changed their upload mode, thus the command couldn't work. That huge bug is present in Nexa's repo)*
+ Created a TimeFormatter with seconds as input
+ Created upload file count (buggy). Barely saves in DB + only shows up in logs when user selected upload all mode
+ Logs message now replies to the concerned archive. Better if multiple archives are processed at the same time

+ Fixed major bug : REPLY_MARKUP_TOO_LONG (refer to [issue #2](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/2))

### v4.0.0
+ Added logging instead of print
+ Bot sends start time to logs *(may send stop time as well, but I need to handle SIGTERM gracefully)*
